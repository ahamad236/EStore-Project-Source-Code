		 FACING CHALLANGES WHILE WORKING ON PROJECT
		--------------------------------------------

1) if we want to handle any dom event only on parent and we don't want it to handle on child then we have to handle like below
		if(event.target === event.currentTarget)
		{
			// Our code should be here
		}


2) have to check why & (bitwise and operator) use in c# asp.net core web api

-> i have parent element class row, and its children are having col-xxl-4 col-xl-4 flexbox classes and for parent i have set height, the issue was if number of children elements are less for example having two rows then the children rows are occupying full height of container, so there was gap coming between rows
      SOLUTION : for parent element which is having row class, have to set align-content-start class


-> focus started on FOCUS8W, windows application, if we want any bl method to change then we have to change in FOCUS8W and then we have to make it as bat file and then run that bat file so wherever in our system, like that bl folder is usable in FOCUS9, FOCUSX, FOCUSXI so everywehre this file will be replaced. so we have share that dlls to others they will replace in their project locations


-> to start focus9 project, if browser is showing unable to make the session state request to the state server. 
Then   windows+R    ->	services.msc	->   click on ASP.NET State Service	->		click on start

-> If we declare variable without using var, let, const then it declared as global vairable but it's not good way
-> If we add 'use strict' on starting of the js file then runtime erros will come for undeclared variables

-> If client side and server side types doesn't match then 400 bad request will come

              ------------------

-> If we define class and used as type of property of another class but when data is getting from api in the api data if that property is not avaiblable in function in client side we have to initialize that property to default value otherwise it's coming as undefined in later functions


-> If while sending data to api, if we don't want some properties then we can do like below using object destructuring
     arrayName.map(({prop1, prop2, ...props}) => props)
   in the above syntax prop1 and prop2 will be deleted


-> If we have large structure in API and if we don't need to define all the properties in client side then we can do like below
			let obj: any;
			obj = {};
			obj.prop1 = 'val';
			obj.prop2 = true;
NOTE: in api parameters these two properties must match and properties type should be same

-> if we want to extract substring from string we have to use stringVariable.slice(startindex, endindex),   it will extract text including startindex to endindex-1, it will not mutate the original value



-> I am getting data from api which is having of type 5 properties and then i want to add extra 3 properties to that variable with some assigned values, below code will work

  arrFields.map( (element: class1) => ({ ...element, prop6:'abc', prop7:'ccc', prop8:'zyc' }))



-> I am having array of elements and for each element i am having 10 properties in client side, so i want to pass that array of elements with only 7 properties, below code will work

  arrFields.map( ({ prop8, prop9, prop10, ...rest }) => rest ) 



=======================================================================


                  24-05-2025 FACED CHALLANGES
                -------------------------------


1) If we want to send object to api whether you are retrieving data or whehter you are sending data, we have to use post only otherwise api will not being called, 415 error will come



2) If we use post method in service in client side and if we put HttpGet attribute for api then we will get 405 error



3) While getting data from clientside to api parameter, then that api parameter having structure defined like VWVoucherFields, in that Tag field is there and for that Tag field, the type would be object. but the data which we are getting having nested sturcutre like Tag.LinkId, so if i want to access objVWVoucherParam.Tag.LinkId error will come : doesn't contain definition for LinkId,  so below code will work

	dynamic dynamicObjVWVoucherParam = objVWVoucherParam;
	int linkId = 0;
	if(dynamicObjVWVoucherParam.Tag.TryGetProperty("LinkId", out JsonElement linkIdElement)){
 		linkId = linkIdElement.GetInt32();	// Depending on the type
	}



4) If we want to add element to array we can add as below
	class IdNamePair{
 		int Id {get; set;}
		string sName {get; set;}
		string sCaption {get; set;}
		object Tag {get; set;}
	}


          IdNamePair[] arrayVariableName = new IdNamePair[10];
 	  arrayVariableName[0] = new IdNamePair({ 1, null, null, 25 });

   NOTE : if we have overloads then for string type properties we have to pass null

	-> If any property is having value null, which property was useful while sending data to database, so this error will come. If we pass default value without null for that property then issue will gone

-> dll issue, if any property missing in class so while sending data to database this exception will come in API
